## Setup: Common Errors

**Gradle Errors**

If Gradle is unable to build due to the following error error:
`Failed to resolve: com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:10.2.0`

1. In Android Studio, go to Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager
2. Select the standalone SDK Manager from the bottom
3. Install/Update 2 packages (they should be under `Extra`:
    * Google Play Services
    * Google Repository
4. Rebuild your gradle.

##Firebase Cloud Messaging

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform solution capable of sending remote notifications and messages to various client phones (downstream messaging). 
Alternatively a client phone can also send a message back to FCM (upstream messaging). 

### Firebase Message Types
Firebase primarily sends 2 types of messages (they can also be combined)

- **Notification message**
    - Light-weight 2KB limit message with a pre-defined set of keys. When the client receives a notification typically a standard Android notification is launched. 
- **Data message**
    - Heavier 4KB limit message with custom key-value pairs for you to group your own data into. Note that sending a data message alone will not trigger any notification.
- **Combination of the above**
    - When the client taps on the Android notification generated by the notification message they can also access the `data` field.

The table below outlines how messages are handled depending on the app state.

| App state      | Notification	        | Data	                | Combined                         |
|----------------|:--------------------:|:---------------------:|---------------------------------:|
| Foreground     | onMessageReceived()	| onMessageReceived()	| onMessageReceived                |
| Background	 | System tray          | onMessageReceived()	| system tray and extras of intent |

### Priority
FCM has two options for assigning delivery priority of messages.

- **Normal Priority**
    - This is the default for data messages; in this priority no network connection is made on a sleeping device and the delivery may be delayed.
    - Use this for non time-sensitive messages such as notification of new emails or data to sync.
- **High Priority**
    - This is the default for notification messages; in this priority FCM is allowed to wake a sleeping device when possible to transmit.
    - Use this for important messages such as instant messaging, chat, alerts, etc...
    - Note that this can drain your client's battery more compare to low priority mode.

### Lifespan
FCM usually delivers messages immediately after they are sent; however if the receiving device is offline or unavailable FCM might intentionally delay the message by storing it and delivering it later.

- This is to prevent the app from consuming resources and affecting battery life.
- Use the `time_to_live` parameter in HTTP and XMPP request to specify the maximum lifespan of a message in the range of 0 to 2419200 seconds (4 weeks). 
    - By default the lifespan is the maximum value.

###Collapsible vs Non-collapsible

- **Collapsible** messages only show the most recent by replacing the old message that contains the same collapse key. 
    - FCM allows a max of 4 different collapse keys per devices.
    - Use this if only the latest data is important (ie: Sports app which notifies with current game score).
- **Non-collapsible** is the opposite where each message will not be replaced.
    - Use this if every single message is important to the client and needs to be delivered (ie: Instant messaging app).

### Sending a message via HTTP POST
Using a program like [Advance REST Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo) you can easily send a HTTP request to the app server.

1. Set the URL to `https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send`
2. Set the Request Method to `POST`
3. Include the HTTP headers fields
```
    "accept": "application/json"
    "content-type": "application/json"
    "authorization": "key=<FIREBASE APP SERVER KEYâ€¦ASK SIMON>
```

In the payload you can do the following to send a combined message:
```json
{
    "to" : "<DEVICE ID OR TOPIC>",
    "data" : {
        "message" : "This is a message POST-ed to Firebase app server!",
        "another-key" : "This is another value"
    },
    "notification" : {
        "body" : "This is from a POST to FIREBASE",
        "title" : "Neverlost Firebase"
    }
}
```

If you neglect to put the `notification` field, or the correct pre-defined keys for the notification field then the end users will only get a data message in `onMessageRecieved()` (regardless if its in the background or foreground) without being notified by the Android notification.
